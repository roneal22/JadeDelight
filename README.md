A PDF with the code you added (not mine)  and the URL of the working page online

Tasks
Your task is to add functionality to the HTML page provided.
You will need to figure out how the page was created as well as to write the 
Javascript/jQuery for the additional requirements.

You may change the: 
	page formatting 
	and the HTML 
but not the Javascript code already in 
place without asking permission first.

The following functionality should be added to the page:

 	1-When a user selects a quantity the amount should automatically be filled into the corresponding total cost box.
	2-The subtotal, tax, and total should update and be filled in
 	9-If there are no validation issues, display a message that 
 		a-thanks the user for their order, 
 		b-displays the order, 
 		c-the pickup or delivery time 
 		d-as well as the total amount for the order.
 extra credit: display the order in a separate window/tab (instead of using an alert). 
Hint:  create a new window object.
